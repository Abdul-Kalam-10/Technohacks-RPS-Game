Game Description:
The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a simple and popular hand game played between two players, typically referred to as "Player 1" and "Player 2" (or "Computer").
The game has a straightforward set of rules, making it easy to understand and play. It is often used as a decision-making tool or a fun pastime.
Objective:
The objective of the game is to defeat the opponent by choosing one of three possible hand gestures: "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors."
The outcome of the game is determined based on the gestures chosen by both players.
Rules:
1.Rock crushes Scissors: If Player 1 chooses "Rock" and Player 2 chooses "Scissors," then Player 1 wins.
2.Paper covers Rock: If Player 1 chooses "Paper" and Player 2 chooses "Rock," then Player 1 wins.
3.Scissors cut Paper: If Player 1 chooses "Scissors" and Player 2 chooses "Paper," then Player 1 wins.
4.If both players choose the same gesture, the game results in a tie, and no one wins.
Implementation:
The game can be implemented using various platforms and technologies.
For a simple text-based version, the program can prompt the user to input their choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computer (Player 2) can randomly generate its choice.
The program then evaluates the choices, determines the winner, and displays the result.
